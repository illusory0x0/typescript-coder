# Task: S-expression parser

Create `src/sexp.ts` with a small, dependency-free S-expression parser.

## Public API

```ts
export type Sexp = string | number | Sexp[];

export function parseSexp(text: string): Sexp;
```

`parseSexp` parses exactly one expression from the whole input. Leading and
trailing whitespace (`space`, tab, LF, CR) is allowed. If the input is empty or
whitespace-only, contains an unmatched parenthesis, or contains more than one
expression, throw a `SyntaxError`.

## Atoms

- Numeric atoms match an optional leading `-`, one or more digits, and an
  optional `.` followed by one or more digits. Convert them with `Number`.
  Examples: `42` -> `42`, `-7` -> `-7`, `3.5` -> `3.5`.
- Every other atom is a symbol and remains a string. Symbols may contain any
  characters other than whitespace, `(`, and `)`. Examples: `foo` -> `"foo"`,
  `+` -> `"+"`, `foo-bar?` -> `"foo-bar?"`.
- There are no string literals; quotes are ordinary symbol characters.

## Lists

- `()` is an empty list.
- A list is zero or more expressions between parentheses; whitespace separates
  items and may appear anywhere between tokens.
- Lists nest arbitrarily. `(a (b 1) ())` parses as
  `["a", ["b", 1], []]`.
- After the one top-level expression, only whitespace may remain. A stray or
  trailing `)` is an error, as is a second expression such as `a b` or
  `(a b) c`.

## Constraints

- Edit only `src/sexp.ts`; do not change `src/sexp.test.ts` or `tsconfig.json`.
- The fixture contains only those files. Do not create scratch files.
- The visible tests are the acceptance check: `bun test` and
  `bunx tsc --noEmit` must pass.
