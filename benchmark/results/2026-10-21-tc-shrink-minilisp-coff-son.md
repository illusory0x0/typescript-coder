## Frozen task specs

### minilisp

Issue (verbatim, identical for both sides):

```
Implement src/lisp.ts exporting LispValue and run(program: string): LispValue
so that src/lisp.test.ts passes and `bunx tsc --noEmit` stays clean.
Create or modify only src/lisp.ts - no other files, no scratch files;
src/lisp.test.ts and tsconfig.json are read-only.
The fixture contains only those files - nothing else to explore.
The test file is the specification; implement what it requires, nothing more.
Verify with `bun test` and `bunx tsc --noEmit` only.
```

## Token and cost accounting

Like-for-like tokens (#89): the comparison total is cache-excluded — total =
cache-miss input (`in`) + output, with reasoning counted as output — normalized for
both sides by the single bucket normalization in `src/benchmark-pricing.ts`.
Cache-hit input stays in each run's raw buckets but is excluded from the total, so
the two sides compare on the same basis.

tc: OpenAI-compatible `usage` from the provider, summed over every chat request
(input/prompt, output/completion, total; cache and reasoning counters are kept per
record).

oc: usage read from `opencode session export` (`info.tokens`), falling back to
`opencode stats --json`; input/output come from the reported session usage and total
is derived from input + output + reasoning when the export reports none; the export's
own `cost` stays verbatim in `rawUsage`.

Cost: USD per run, computed from the recorded buckets and the run's
`startedAt`/`finishedAt` window with the official DeepSeek V4.1-Flash peak/off-peak
prices (see `src/benchmark-pricing.ts`). Buckets: tc `input` includes cache hits
(miss = input - cacheRead); oc `input` excludes them (miss = input, hit = cacheRead);
output is priced together with reasoning; `cacheWrite` is priced at the cache-miss
rate. A run that crosses a peak/off-peak boundary splits by elapsed-time share
(uniform-spend approximation). USD columns are decision-only: cost is recorded in the
result JSON and `consumption.md` for decisions, but the headline comparison metric is
the cache-excluded token total above.

## Per-task results

| Task | Side | Success | Mean in (no cache) | Mean out | Mean total | Mean $ | $/success | Mean dur (s) | Mean steps |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | 5/5 | 31,835 | 3,854 | 35,689 | $0.00712 | $0.00712 | 42.7 | 21.6 |

## Overall comparison

| Side | Success | Mean in (no cache) | Mean out | Mean total | Total tokens | Mean $ | Total $ | $/success | Mean dur (s) | Mean steps |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | 5/5 | 31,835 | 3,854 | 35,689 | 178,443 | $0.00712 | $0.03558 | $0.00712 | 42.7 | 21.6 |

Per success (usage-run sums divided by successful runs):

| Side | In (no cache) | Out | Total | Cost |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | 31,835 | 3,854 | 35,689 | $0.00712 |

Only one side ran: tc 5/5 (100.0%).

Token multiplier (cache-excluded): not comparable (both sides must run).

*Pricing footnote (decision-only):* USD costs use the official DeepSeek V4.1-Flash peak/off-peak
rates (fetched 2026-10-19 from https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing; USD per 1M tokens):
cache-hit input $0.006 peak / $0.003 off-peak; cache-miss input $0.30 / $0.15;
output $1.20 / $0.60. Peak hours are Mon-Fri 01:00-04:00 and 06:00-10:00 UTC,
excluding Chinese public holidays; every other hour is off-peak. A run straddling
a boundary splits its cost by elapsed-time share.

## Selector adoption (#101)

Per task and side (payloads that used each selector):

| Task | Side | range | matcher | whole-symbol |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | 0 | 37 | 35 |

| Side | range | matcher | whole-symbol |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | 0 | 37 | 35 |

Resolved cascade stages and matcher kinds (#110):

Per task and side (payloads that resolved at each stage / used each matcher):

| Task | Side | whole-symbol | match | pick | snippet | regex |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | 35 | 37 | 0 | 37 | 0 |

| Side | whole-symbol | match | pick | snippet | regex |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | 35 | 37 | 0 | 37 | 0 |

Implicit creates (#111):

| Task | Side | creates |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | 0 |

| Side | creates |
| --- | ---: |
| tc | 0 |

## Raw runs

Provider-reported buckets, verbatim: tc `Raw in`/`Raw total` include cache hits;
oc `Raw in` excludes them. The cache-excluded comparison total is in the tables
above (and each row's `tokens.billable`), not here.

| Task | Side | Rep | OK | Raw in | Raw out | Raw total | Cost | Rate | Steps | Dur (s) |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | 1 | yes | 35,125 | 3,492 | 38,617 | $0.00640 | off-peak | 21 | 38.1 |
| minilisp | tc | 2 | yes | 8,683 | 2,515 | 11,198 | $0.00219 | off-peak | 6 | 15.3 |
| minilisp | tc | 3 | yes | 9,287 | 3,114 | 12,401 | $0.00275 | off-peak | 6 | 18.6 |
| minilisp | tc | 4 | yes | 47,715 | 4,485 | 52,200 | $0.00855 | off-peak | 26 | 50.1 |
