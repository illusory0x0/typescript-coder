## Frozen task specs

### minilisp

Issue (verbatim, identical for both sides):

```
Implement src/lisp.ts exporting LispValue and run(program: string): LispValue
so that src/lisp.test.ts passes and `bunx tsc --noEmit` stays clean.
Create or modify only src/lisp.ts - no other files, no scratch files;
src/lisp.test.ts and tsconfig.json are read-only.
The fixture contains only those files - nothing else to explore.
The test file is the specification; implement what it requires, nothing more.
Verify with `bun test` and `bunx tsc --noEmit` only.
```

## Cache warm-up

Only the cache-stable system prefixes were warmed; task-specific user prompts were not. These calls are excluded from every measured token/cost table.

| Agent mode | Prefix | Prompt chars | Raw in | Cache read | Cache hit | Duration (s) | Error |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| plan-exec | planning | 1900 | n/a | n/a | n/a | 0.7 | none |
| plan-exec | execution | 1721 | n/a | n/a | n/a | 1.3 | none |

## Token and cost accounting

Like-for-like tokens (#89): the comparison total is cache-excluded — total =
cache-miss input (`in`) + output, with reasoning counted as output — normalized for
both sides by the single bucket normalization in `src/benchmark-pricing.ts`.
Cache-hit input stays in each run's raw buckets but is excluded from the total, so
the two sides compare on the same basis.

tc: OpenAI-compatible `usage` from the provider, summed over every chat request
(input/prompt, output/completion, total; cache and reasoning counters are kept per
record).

oc: usage read from `opencode session export` (`info.tokens`), falling back to
`opencode stats --json`; input/output come from the reported session usage and total
is derived from input + output + reasoning when the export reports none; the export's
own `cost` stays verbatim in `rawUsage`.

Cost: USD per run, computed from the recorded buckets and the run's
`startedAt`/`finishedAt` window with the official DeepSeek V4.1-Flash peak/off-peak
prices (see `src/benchmark-pricing.ts`). Buckets: tc `input` includes cache hits
(miss = input - cacheRead); oc `input` excludes them (miss = input, hit = cacheRead);
output is priced together with reasoning; `cacheWrite` is priced at the cache-miss
rate. A run that crosses a peak/off-peak boundary splits by elapsed-time share
(uniform-spend approximation). USD columns are decision-only: cost is recorded in the
result JSON and `consumption.md` for decisions, but the headline comparison metric is
the cache-excluded token total above.

## Per-task results

| Task | Side | Protocol | Agent mode | Success | Mean in (no cache) | Cache hit | Mean out | Mean total | Mean $ | $/success | Mean dur (s) | Mean steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0/1 | 50,623 | 61.8% | 12,989 | 63,612 | $0.01563 | n/a | 62.7 | 22.0 |

## Overall comparison

| Side | Protocol | Agent mode | Success | Mean in (no cache) | Cache hit | Mean out | Mean total | Total tokens | Mean $ | Total $ | $/success | Mean dur (s) | Mean steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0/1 | 50,623 | 61.8% | 12,989 | 63,612 | 63,612 | $0.01563 | $0.01563 | n/a | 62.7 | 22.0 |

Per success (usage-run sums divided by successful runs):

| Side | Protocol | Agent mode | In (no cache) | Out | Total | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |

## Cache hit balance

Cache hit = cacheRead / raw prompt tokens (tc input includes hits; oc input excludes them).

| Side | Protocol | Agent mode | Cache hit | Cache-read tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 61.8% | 81,920 |

Only one side ran: tc plan-exec 0/1 (0.0%).

Token multiplier (cache-excluded): not comparable (both sides must run).

## Four-way comparison (oc / tc json / tc edit / tc plan-exec)

Baselines: oc `benchmark/results/oc-baseline.json` (deepseek/deepseek-flash, 3 reps, 2026-10-24); tc json `benchmark/results/json-format-baseline.json` (deepseek-flash, 3 reps, 2026-10-24).
Factor = baseline mean / variant mean; above 1 means the variant used that many times fewer cache-excluded tokens.

| Task | Variant | Mean total | Cache hit | vs oc baseline | vs tc json baseline |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | oc baseline | 12,807 | n/a | 1.00x | 0.56x |
| minilisp | tc json baseline | 7,139 | n/a | 1.79x | 1.00x |
| minilisp | tc plan-exec | 63,612 | 61.8% | 0.20x | 0.11x |
*Pricing footnote (decision-only):* USD costs use the official DeepSeek V4.1-Flash peak/off-peak
rates (fetched 2026-10-19 from https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing; USD per 1M tokens):
cache-hit input $0.006 peak / $0.003 off-peak; cache-miss input $0.30 / $0.15;
output $1.20 / $0.60. Peak hours are Mon-Fri 01:00-04:00 and 06:00-10:00 UTC,
excluding Chinese public holidays; every other hour is off-peak. A run straddling
a boundary splits its cost by elapsed-time share.

## Selector adoption (#101)

Per task and side (payloads that used each selector):

| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| Side | Protocol | Agent mode | range | matcher | whole-symbol |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Resolved cascade stages and matcher kinds (#110):

Per task and side (payloads that resolved at each stage / used each matcher):

| Task | Side | Protocol | Agent mode | whole-symbol | match | pick | snippet | regex |

| minilisp | tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Implicit creates (#111):

| Task | Side | Protocol | Agent mode | creates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| minilisp | tc | edit-dsl | plan-exec | 0 |

| Side | Protocol | Agent mode | creates |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |

## Raw runs

Provider-reported buckets, verbatim: tc `Raw in`/`Raw total` include cache hits;
oc `Raw in` excludes them. The cache-excluded comparison total is in the tables
above (and each row's `tokens.billable`), not here.

| Task | Side | Protocol | Agent mode | Rep | OK | Raw in | Raw out | Raw total | Cost | Rate | Steps | Dur (s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
